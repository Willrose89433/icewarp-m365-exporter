Quick next steps for you
Unzip, cd into the folder, and run npm install.

Set environment variables (recommended) or edit server.js with your real values:

ICEWARP_HOST, ICEWARP_PORT, ICEWARP_ADMIN_USER, ICEWARP_ADMIN_PASS

M365_TENANT_ID, M365_CLIENT_ID, M365_CLIENT_SECRET

Start server: npm start

Trigger export:

POST http://<server>:3000/export with optional JSON body { "users": ["user1@example.com","user2@example.com"] }

Response contains report path (e.g. /reports/export-report-...csv) you can download.

Caveats & production hardening (already noted in README)
Do not run with client secret in source on public machines; use environment variables or a secrets manager.

Adjust IceWarp paths (the code assumes /users/<username>/Contacts/ and /users/<username>/Calendar/). If your IceWarp layout differs, update lib/icewarp.js.

Consider adding:

Rate-limit handling for Graph (inspect 429 responses to back off longer).

Support for very large mailboxes via job queue and resume points.

More comprehensive vCard fields mapping (addresses, multiple emails, photos).

Unit tests, and CI deployment.
